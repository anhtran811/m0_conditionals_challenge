# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
*I feel pretty confident with my comparison operators. Being able to test the code to confirm
the output helps my confirm as I go.*

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
*I feel confident with logical operators. I do well with hearing and seeing problems/solutions
so talking the code and output out to myself definitely helps.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
*I definitely have to talk my if statements out to myself a few times to confirm that
I am understanding the conditionals properly and covering all conditions. With that, I
am confident with if statements.*

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
*This lesson took me about 2 hours to complete. I estimated about 2-3 hours to complete this.*

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
*I think I need to practice making my codes "neat" and more organized. With the if statements, sometimes I make too 
many branches then realize I can condense them into fewer branches. I think it will just take time and practice
because right now, I want to make sure I am not missing anything so I tend to veer on the side of more detail.
I don't think I necessarily need to adjust my calendar, just be more concise with my code.*

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
*At this time, I do not have any questions. Especially because we just went over this lesson and a lot of
my questions were answered. Sorry about that.*
